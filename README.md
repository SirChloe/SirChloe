### Hello world •°. *࿐
- Im known as *Astro*, but i'd prefer if non-close friends called me ***Jung or Venus***
- I play that dumb horse game full of mentally-ill people from Twitter
- I say that like i'm not 1/2 of them (i don't use twitter)
- I honestly don't give a damn about what pronouns you use for me as long as it's not he/him (even though i'm cis and **not** proud)
